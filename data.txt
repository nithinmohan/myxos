INTRODUCTION



Cloud computing
 is a model for
 enabling ubiqu
itous, convenie
nt, on-demand n
etwork access t
o a shared pool
 of configurabl
e computing res
ources (e.g., n
etworks, server
s, storage, 

applications, a
nd services) th
at can be rapid
ly provisioned 
and released wi
th minimal mana
gement effort o
r service provi
der interaction
. [1 from repor
t_S7]. Load Bal
ancing is the 

process of dist
ributing the lo
ad among variou
s nodes of a di
stributed syste
m when it becom
es difficult to
 predict the nu
mber of request
s that will be 
issued to a ser
ver. It conside
rs 

factors like ex
ecution time, r
esource availab
ility and requi
rement among ot
hers to improve
 job response t
ime, throughput
, etc. In order
 to provide bet
ter service-lev
el agreements, 


the cloud provi
der has to prov
ide such improv
ements to the u
ser.



Quality of Serv
ice (QoS) is th
e resource rese
rvation control
 mechanism in p
lace to guarant
ee a certain le
vel of performa
nce and availab
ility of a serv
ice. It provide
s a level of as
surance 

that the resour
ce requirements
 of an applicat
ion are strictl
y supported. It
 is possible th
at the resource
 requirement of
 a user may not
 be supported b
y the cloud pro
vider. In such 


scenarios, the 
cloud provider 
has to provide 
a means of exec
uting the user'
s load. The clo
ud provider has
 to decide the 
appropriate str
ategy such that
 the user's nee
ds are met. One
 of 

the most intere
sting aspects i
n Cloud Computi
ng is the feeli
ng of availabil
ity of 'infinit
e' computing re
sources that th
e cloud provide
r tries to dist
ribute to the u
ser in an elast
ic way. 

The user does n
ot fully realiz
e the internal 
allocations whi
le demanding fo
r more resource
s.





For this infini
te demand of th
e user to be me
t, the cloud pr
ovider has to f
ind ways to do 
it while incurr
ing no loss. On
e of the approa
ches to do it i
s to calculate 
the number of t
imes 

the provider do
es not have the
 capacity to ex
ecute the load 
and based on th
at draw up an a
greement with a
nother provider
 to execute the
 load. This cal
culation can be
 predicted from
 

past data throu
gh forecasting 
and also by inc
luding the curr
ent data using 
game theory, st
andard deviatio
n can help in d
eciding the str
ategy of the cl
oud provider.

A system compos
ed of a virtual
 network of vir
tual machines c
apable of live 
migration acros
s multi- domain
 physical infra
structure have 
been constructe
d. By using dyn
amic availabili
ty of 

infrastructure 
resources and d
ynamic applicat
ion demand, a v
irtual computat
ion environment
 is able to aut
omatically relo
cate itself acr
oss the infrast
ructure and sca
le its resource
s. Thus 

the QoS improve
ments can be me
t using this vi
rtual machine s
etup. Depending
 on the type of
 application, t
he generated wo
rkload can be a
 highly varying
 process that t
urns difficult 
to 

find an accepta
ble trade-off b
etween an expen
sive over-provi
sioning able to
 anticipate pea
k loads and a s
ub performing r
esource allocat
ion that does n
ot 

mobilize enough
 resources. The
se properties c
an be leveraged
 to derive a pr
obabilistic ass
umption on the 
mean workload o
f the system at
 different time
 resolutions. 



There are many 
proposals that 
dynamically man
age Virtual Mac
hines by optimi
zing some objec
tive function s
uch as minimizi
ng cost functio
n, cost perform
ance function 

and meeting QoS
 objectives. Th
e objective fun
ction is define
d as Utility pr
operty which is
 selected based
 on measures of
 response time,
 number of QoS,
 

targets met and
 profit etc. Th
is Utility prop
erty can then b
e adjusted to i
nclude factors 
of individual i
mportance. Thes
e appraoches ha
ve been modifie
d to 

meet needs acco
rding to curren
t demand. But t
hey may prove c
omplex and  may
 not work in a 
practical virtu
alization cloud
 system 

with real workl
oad. These appr
oaches work bes
t for stationar
y demands and m
ay not give opt
imal solution f
or dynamic reso
urce requiremen
ts. The utility
 property can b
e modified to 

include dynamic
 demands and al
location. This 
requires formul
ating the appro
priate utility 
property that c
aptures these d
emands.





CONCLUSION



In this paper, 
we have discuss
ed one approach
 of how the ill
usion of infini
te resources in
 Cloud Computin
g can be furthe
r optimized wit
hout incurring 
any loss for th
e cloud provide
r. 

QoS can be impr
oved and thus p
rovide the user
 with better fa
cilities. The c
loud provider c
an decide wheth
er he wants to 
rent out the lo
ad and prevent 
disappointing t
he user or just
 

execute what is
 possible. Fore
casting followe
d by game theor
y gives a bette
r approach of i
ncluding the da
ta available ti
ll the current 
point and will 
help in correct
ly 

deciding the st
rategies. From 
these results, 
a cloud provide
r can also chec
k the number of
 times he is re
nting out the l
oad and based o
n further calcu
lations he can 
decide to own 

more facilities
 such that the 
frequency of re
nting will decr
ease and he may
 earn more prof
it. This can be
 modelled as a 
Ski-Rental prob
lem and further
 worked out.



This paper prov
ides one method
 of tackling th
e problem and i
t further opens
 up interesting
 avenues for im
provement. The 
utility propert
y can be change
d to suit the 

agreement betwe
en the provider
 and the user. 
This approach c
 onsiders execu
tion time as on
e of the factor
s and this may 
change dependin
g on the networ
k traffic 

and other dynam
ic factors whic
h will further 
complicate the 
utility propert
y. There can be
 different util
ity functions t
hat can be used
 conmsidering m
ore factors. 

Other game-theo
retic concepts 
and forecasting
 models can als
o be used to ob
tain results. S
ince the avenue
s are deep and 
the domain is s
till growing, u
pdates on 

this problem wi
ll keep on incr
easing until an
 optimal soluti
on is reached.





ABSTRACT



As Cloud Comput
ing is an emerg
ing field, many
 improvements a
re being propos
ed to provide u
sers with bette
r services and 
facilities. Thi
s paper deals w
ith one of the 
aspects of Clou
d 

Computing which
 is an illusion
 of infinite re
source availabi
lity on demand.
 A c ombination
 of forecasting
 models and gam
e theoretic app
roaches have be
en proposed so 
as 

to continue pro
viding this ill
usion without a
ny glitches. Th
is implementati
on is a new way
 of looking at 
the problem and
 with co-ordina
tion from diffe
rent providers 
it becomes poss
ible 

for each provid
er to decide on
 his best strat
egy.  Game theo
ry is a concept
 that is genera
lly applied for
 economics and 
hence is a good
 way to engage 
it in deciding 
the economical 


capabilities of
 the company wh
ich can be done
 by adding it t
o the utility p
roperty. This c
an be further e
nhanced by incl
uding more fact
ors in the util
ity and proivin
ding methods fo
r 

scalability.
